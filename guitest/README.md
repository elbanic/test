## Tax Calculator

Write a simple program that calculates the tax for the price you entered.
The program receives the state name along with the order price.
If the state name is 'WI', the tax rate is 5.5%.
The program prints the subtotals, tax rates, and totals for Wisconsin residents, but only if you live in another state.

* Output Example:
  <br>*What is the order amount? 10*
  <br>*What is the state? WI*
  <br>*The subtotal is $10.00*
  <br>*The tax is $0.55*
  <br>*The total is $10.55*

  or
  
  <br>*What is the order amount? 10*
  <br>*What is the state? MN*
  <br>*The total is $10.55*

* Conditions
  * Write it using only the if statement (never use the else statement).
  * All amounts should be rounded to the nearest cent.
  * Use only one output statement at the end of the program to output the result.
